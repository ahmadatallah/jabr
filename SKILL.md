# jabr — stacked pull requests

Reunite a feature's broken-down pieces into one clean, reviewable whole: a
**stack** of small, dependent PRs instead of one giant one. This skill plans the
decomposition and writes the code; a TypeScript engine handles the git/`gh`
mechanics (parent tracking, `rebase --onto`, force-push ordering, PR base wiring).

## Running the engine

Invoke the bundled engine with Bun, using its absolute path in the installed skill:

```bash
bun ~/.claude/skills/jabr/scripts/jabr.ts <command> [args]
```

All commands run against the user's **current** git repository (their working
directory), not the skill directory. Stack metadata lives in that repo's local
git config. Prerequisites: a git repo, Bun, and (for `submit`/`sync`) `gh auth login`.

If the user prefers, suggest an alias: `alias jabr='bun ~/.claude/skills/jabr/scripts/jabr.ts'`.

## Mental model

- The **trunk** (usually `main`) is the root.
- Each branch in a stack is **stacked on** its parent and contains one coherent
  change. Its PR's base is its parent branch, so the PR's diff shows only that
  change — not everything below it.
- When a lower branch changes (new commits, an amend, a rebase onto an advanced
  trunk), every branch above it must be **restacked** (rebased) to stay current.
  `jabr` does this automatically and exactly, replaying only each branch's own
  commits so nothing is duplicated.

## Workflow

### 1. Plan the stack

Before writing code, decompose the feature into an ordered list of small,
independently-reviewable units — each becomes one branch/PR. A typical ordering:
schema/migration → data layer → API/business logic → UI → tests/docs. Keep each
unit focused and buildable on its own. See
[references/planning.md](references/planning.md) for heuristics and a worked example.

Confirm the plan with the user before creating branches.

### 2. Build the stack

For each unit, create a branch, write the code, and commit:

```bash
bun ~/.claude/skills/jabr/scripts/jabr.ts init                 # once: record the trunk
# implement unit 1, then:
bun ~/.claude/skills/jabr/scripts/jabr.ts create api-schema -a -m "Add user schema + migration"
# implement unit 2 (now stacked on api-schema), then:
bun ~/.claude/skills/jabr/scripts/jabr.ts create api-endpoints -a -m "Add /users endpoints"
```

Inspect and move around the stack with `log`, `up`, `down`, `top`, `bottom`,
`checkout`.

### 3. Submit

```bash
bun ~/.claude/skills/jabr/scripts/jabr.ts submit --stack
```

Pushes each branch (root-first) and opens/updates one PR per branch with its base
wired to its parent, then writes a stack-navigation block into every PR body. Use
`--draft` for drafts, `--no-push` to only sync PR metadata.

### 4. Address review feedback

Edit the relevant branch, then let `jabr` realign everything above it:

```bash
bun ~/.claude/skills/jabr/scripts/jabr.ts down          # go to the branch under review
# fix code
bun ~/.claude/skills/jabr/scripts/jabr.ts modify -a     # amend + auto-restack descendants
bun ~/.claude/skills/jabr/scripts/jabr.ts submit --stack
```

### 5. Sync after merges

When PRs merge (via GitHub), bring the local stack up to date:

```bash
bun ~/.claude/skills/jabr/scripts/jabr.ts sync            # ff trunk, report merged, restack
bun ~/.claude/skills/jabr/scripts/jabr.ts sync --delete   # also delete merged branches + restack
```

## Command reference

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `init [trunk]` | Set/auto-detect the trunk |
| `create <name> [-a] [-m msg]` | Branch off current HEAD, track parent, optional stage+commit |
| `modify [-a] [-m msg] [-c]` | Amend (or `-c` new) commit, then restack descendants |
| `track <name> [-p parent]` / `untrack [name]` | Add/remove a branch from the stack |
| `log` / `status` | Show the stack tree |
| `parent` / `children` / `trunk` | Inspect the graph |
| `checkout <b>` · `up [-n]` · `down [-n]` · `top` · `bottom` | Navigate |
| `restack [branch]` | Rebase a branch + descendants onto their parents |
| `move --onto <target>` | Reparent the current branch, restack descendants |
| `rename [old] <new>` · `delete <name>` | Rename / delete (children reparented) |
| `squash [-m msg]` | Collapse a branch's commits into one, restack descendants |
| `submit [--stack] [--draft] [--no-push]` | Push + create/update PRs with bases + nav |
| `sync [--delete]` | Fast-forward trunk, detect merged PRs, restack remaining |

## Handling conflicts

If a restack hits a rebase conflict, the engine stops and prints the failing
branch. Resolve the conflict in the working tree, run `git rebase --continue`
(or `git rebase --abort`), then re-run `restack`. Never leave the stack
half-restacked — finish or abort before continuing other operations.

## Out of scope

`jabr` does only what plain git + `gh` do well. Anything needing a hosted service
— a merge queue, a web review UI, server-side stack management — is out of scope;
merge through GitHub, then `sync`. For less-common local operations (reorder,
split, absorb) see [references/workflow.md](references/workflow.md).
